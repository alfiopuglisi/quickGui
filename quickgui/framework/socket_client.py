    TCP client for queue-based communication.

    Runs an infinite loop where it will connect to the specified host
    and port, send whatever data comes from qout to the socket, and puts
    any incoming data from the socket into qin.

    qin and qout are seen from the perspective of the client, so qin is data
    going to the client, and qout is data going to the task.

    If the server connection is lost, this client will automatically try
    to reconnect in an infinite loop instead of shutting down.
