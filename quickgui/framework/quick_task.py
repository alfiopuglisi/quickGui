TODO: handlers with type checking:

...

a caching "send" method that only calls qout.put when the value
is different from the last one, to reduce traffic.

a keepalive mechanism so that every X seconds a value is sent out
even if the task does not do anything.

    A task that dispatches commands to handler functions

    When the command 'CMD' is received, the method decorated with
    @handler('CMD') is called, together with an optional argument.
    In addition, a 'PERIODIC' command is inserted
    at regular intervals in the queue.

    Even if this class uses threads internally, handlers are not
    multi-threaded. All handlers run sequentially in the same thread.
